Backend:

node.js - file-handler
    1. /uploads - stores the files uploaded from frontend
    2. app.js   - contains the backend code
        a. handles uploaded file
        b. writes info of the file to data.json
        c. executes the c++ executable
    3. data.json - stores info about the last uploaded file like name, path, etc.

c++
    1. parser.cpp - contains the main code
        a. extracts file info from data.json in node folder
        b. finds the file in /uploads folder
        c. extracts data from the file
        d. stores data into the parser.json file
    2. parser.exe - the executable file to be run
    3. parser.json - executable stores the info into the json file


Frontend:

Angular - src
    1. app.component.ts - handles the upload files
        calls post req on new file

points to remember:

1. 
add: 
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
to tsconfig.json

2. run angular with $ ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
3. run node with nodemon app.js
4. run npm install on file-handler for node and in root for angular
